heroku run bash --remote heroku
Runs a shell on heroku so you can see any build errors.

	Refresher on workflow
		Connected to workingmatt/arWeb on GitHub only master branch.
		Deploy to heroku using git https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git
		git push heroku master
		Go to https://chanza-chanzo-ar.herokuapp.com/ to see app in action.

	I want to keep Kim's site going. Including the link from chanzachanzo.com for now.
		So I will create a new heroku instance called the-world-is-yours.herokuapp.com
		https://www.heroku.com/ and sign in
		Add a new app called the-world-is-yours

		git remote -v lists the remotes set up.
		git remote rename heroku heroku-kim
		heroku git:remote -a the-world-is-yours
		git push origin master

		https://the-world-is-yours.herokuapp.com/

I moved this to a free heroku thing (in the cloud). My node code needed to be http only as heroku sorts out all the https before forwarding the traffic via internal http.
Heroku user name is matt@chanzachanzo.com
https://chanza-chanza-ar.herokuapp.com is the webpage.
